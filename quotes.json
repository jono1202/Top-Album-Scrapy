Cale introduced the power of pulse and drone (from his work with minimalist composer La Monte Young); guitarist Sterling Morrison and drummer Maureen Tucker played with tribal force; Nico, a German vocalist added to the band by manager Andy Warhol, brought an icy femininity to the heated ennui in Reed's songs.

But at the time it was made,  Kind of Blue  was a revolution all its own, a radical break from everything going on. Turning his back on standard chord progressions, trumpeter  Miles Davis  used modal scales as a starting point for composition and improvisation \u2013 breaking new ground with warmth, subtlety and understatement in the thick of hard bop. Davis and his peerless band \u2013 bassist Paul Chambers, drummer Jimmy Cobb, pianist Bill Evans, and the titanic sax team of John Coltrane and Cannonball Adderley \u2013 soloed in uncluttered settings, typified by \"melodic rather than harmonic variation,\" as Davis put it. Two numbers, \"All Blues\" and \"Freddie Freeloader\" (the latter featured Wynton Kelly at the ivories in place of Evans), were in 12-bar form, but Davis' approach allowed his players a cool, new, collected freedom. Evans wrote in his original liner notes, \"Miles conceived these settings only hours before the re\u00adcording dates and arrived with sketches which indicated to the group what was to be played. Therefore, you will hear something close to pure spontaneity in these performances.\" Or as the late critic Robert Palmer wrote, \" Kind of Blue  is, in a sense, all melody \u2013 and atmosphere.\" The bass line in \"So What\" is now among the most familiar obbligatos in jazz, and there is no finer evocation of the late-night wonder of jazz than the muted horns in \"All Blues.", "title": "Kind of Blue", "publisher": "Columbia", "year": 1959, "artist": "Miles Davis"},

Elvis Presley , guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black were horsing around with \"That's All Right, Mama,\" a tune by bluesman Arthur \"Big Boy\" Crudup, when producer Sam Phillips stopped them and asked, \"What are you doing?\" \"We don't know,\" they said. Phillips told them to \"back up and do it again.\" The A side of Presley's first single (backed with a version of Bill Monroe's \"Blue Moon of Kentucky\"), \"That's All Right\" was issued by Sun on July 19th. It may or may not be the first rock & roll record. But the man who would be King was officially on wax. Bridging black and white, country and blues, his sound was playful and revolutionary, charged by a spontaneity and freedom that changed the world. \"It's the blues,\" critic Greil Marcus wrote in his classic book  Mystery Train . \"But free of all worry, all sin; a simple joy with no price to pay.\" Presley released four more singles on Sun \u2013 including definitive reinventions of Wynonie Harris' \"Good Rockin' Tonight\" and Junior Parker's \"Mystery Train\" \u2013 before moving on to immortality when Phillips sold his contract to RCA for $35,000. Incredibly, it took more than 20 years for Presley's Sun output to be properly collected on a 1976 LP \u2013 which has since been superseded by this 1999 double-CD chronicle of the King's beginnings at Sun.

Yet the creative tension resulted in one of the most intense and adventurous rock albums ever made. Lennon pursued his hard-edged vision into the cynical wit of \"Sexy Sadie\" and \"Happiness Is a Warm Gun,\" but also infused \"Julia\" and \"Dear Prudence\" with childlike yearning.  Paul McCartney 's playful pop energy came through on his inversion of Chuck Berry's American values, \"Back in the U.S.S.R.,\" and he showed off his raucous side in \"Helter Skelter.\" Harrison's spiritual yearning led him to \"Long, Long, Long\" and \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps,\" featuring a guest guitar solo from  Eric Clapton .

After several false-start sessions in New York in the fall of 1965 and January 1966 with his killer road band the Hawks \u2013 \"One of Us Must Know (Sooner or Later)\" was the only keeper \u2013 Dylan blazed through the rest of Blonde on Blonde's 14 tracks in one four-day run and one three-day run at Columbia's Nashville studios in February and March 1966. \r\n The pace of recording echoed the amphetamine velocity of Dylan's songwriting and touring schedule at the time. But the combined presence of trusted hands like organist Al Kooper and Hawks guitarist Robbie Robertson with expert local sessionmen including drummer Kenneth \u00adButtrey and pianist Hargus \"Pig\" Robbins created an almost contradictory magnificence: a tightly wound tension around Dylan's quicksilver language and incisive singing in barrelhouse surrealism such as \"Rainy Day Women #12 & 35\" and \"Stuck Inside of Mobile With the Memphis Blues Again,\" the hilarious Chicago-style blues \"Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat\" and the scornful, fragile \"Just Like a Woman,\" still his greatest ballad. \r\n Amid the frenzy, Dylan delivered some of his finest, clearest songs of comfort and desire: the sidelong beauty of the 11-minute \"Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands,\" recorded in just one take at four in the morning after an eight-hour session, and \"I Want You,\" the title of which Dylan almost used for the album", "title": "Blonde on Blonde", "publisher": "Columbia", "year": 1966, "artist": "Bob Dylan"},

Produced with no-surrender energy by legendary Seventies studio madman Guy Stevens,  the Clash 's third album skids from bleak punk (\"London Calling\") to rampaging ska (\"Wrong 'Em Boyo\") and disco resignation (\"Lost in the Supermarket\"). The album was made in dire straits too. The band was heavily in debt and openly at war with its record company. Singer-guitarists Joe Strummer and Mick Jones wrote together in Jones' grandmother's flat. \"Joe, once he learned how to type, would bang the lyrics out,\" Jones said. \"Then I'd be able to bang out some music while he was hitting the typewriter.\" Strummer, Jones, bassist Paul Simonon and drummer Topper Headon spent nearly three months rehearsing and demoing songs in a garage in the Pimlico section of London \u2013 \"with one light and filthy carpet on the walls for soundproofing,\" recalled Strummer in 1989. \"We felt that we were struggling,\" he said, \"about to slide down a slope or something, grasping with our fingernails.\" But Stevens was on hand for inspiration. He threw chairs around the room \"if he thought a track needed zapping up,\" according to Strummer.

In the existential shuffle \"Tumbling Dice,\" the exhausted country beauty \"Torn and Frayed\" and the whiskey-soaked uplift of \"Shine a Light,\" you literally hear the Stones in exile: working at Richards' villa in the South of France, and on the run from media censure, British drug police (Jagger and Richards already knew the view from behind bars) and the country's onerous tax code.  Exile  is rife with allusions to their outsider status: The album's cover is a collage of freakish American characters, and on \"Sweet Black Angel\" they toast imprisoned activist Angela Davis \u2013 one set of renegades to another. The music rattles like battle but also swings with clear purpose on songs like \"Rocks Off\" and \"All Down the Line.\" As Richards explained, \"The Stones don't have a home anymore \u2013 hence the  Exile  \u2013 but they can still keep it together. Whatever people throw at us, we can still duck, improvise, overcome.\" Great example: Richards recorded his jubilant romp \"Happy\" with just producer Jimmy Miller on drums and saxman Bobby Keys \u2013 while waiting for the other Stones to turn up for work.

He claimed that \"What's Going On\" was the worst song he had ever heard. As for \"Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology),\" Gordy asserted that he didn't even know what the word \"ecology\" meant.

After initially being rejected by Motown's quality-control committee, it was; when the song became a Top Five hit, the album \u2013 and a burst of socially conscious music from Motown \u2013 followed soon after.

{"index": 5, "description": "In 1965, radios were abuzz with such groundbreaking singles as \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\" and \"Like a Rolling Stone.\" That December, the Beatles met their peers' challenge head-on with  Rubber Soul , a stunning collection that preserved the taut pop focus of the band's earlier LPs while introducing newfound sophistication and depth. Producer George Martin described  Rubber Soul  as \"the first album to present a new, growing Beatles to the world,\" and so it was. \r\n The moptops were evolving in remarkable ways. \"Drive My Car\" is a comic character study of a sort not previously in the  Beatles ' repertoire. More profoundly, however,  Bob Dylan 's influence suffuses the album, accounting for the tart emotional tone of \"Norwegian Wood,\" \"I'm Looking Through You,\" \"You Won't See Me\" and \"If I Needed Someone.\" (Dylan would return the compliment the following year, when he offered his own version of \"Norwegian Wood\" \u2013 titled \"4th Time Around\" \u2013 on  Blonde on Blonde , and reportedly made  John Lennon  paranoid.) Lennon's \"Nowhere Man,\" which he later acknowledged as a depressed self-portrait, and the beautifully reminiscent \"In My Life\" both reflect the more serious and personal style of songwriting that Dylan had suddenly made possible. \r\n  George Harrison 's sitar on \"Norwegian Wood\" \u2013 the first time the instrument was used in a pop song \u2013 and  Paul McCartney 's fuzz bass on \"Think for Yourself\" document the band's increasing awareness that the studio could be more than a pit stop between tours. Harrison called  Rubber Soul  \"the best one we made,\" because \"we were suddenly hearing sounds that we weren't able to hear before.\" And as for why the band's hearing had grown so acute, well, that was another aspect of the times. \"There was a lot of experimentation on  Rubber Soul ,\" said  Ringo Starr , \"influenced, I think, by the substances.", "title": "Rubber Soul", "publisher": "Capitol", "year": 1965, "artist": "The Beatles"},

{"index": 3, "description": "\"I don't see too much difference between  Revolver  and  Rubber Soul ,\"  George Harrison  once said. \"To me, they could be Volume One and Volume Two.\"  Revolver  extends the more adventurous aspects of its predecessor \u2013 its introspection, its nascent psychedelia, its fascination with studio artistry \u2013 into a dramatic statement of generational possibility. \r\n The album, which was released in August 1966, made it thrillingly clear that what we now think of as \"the Sixties\" was fully \u2013 and irreversibly \u2013 under way. \r\n The most innovative track on the album is  John Lennon 's \"Tomorrow Never Knows.\" Attempting to distill an LSD trip into a three-minute song, Lennon borrowed lyrics from Timothy Leary's version of  The Tibetan Book of the Dead , and recorded his vocal to sound like \"the Dalai Lama singing from the highest mountaintop.\" Tape loops, a backward guitar part ( Paul McCartney 's blistering solo on \"Taxman,\" in fact) and a droning tamboura completed the experimental effect, and the song proved hugely influential. For his part, on \"Eleanor Rigby\" and \"For No One,\" McCartney mastered a strikingly mature form of art song, and Harrison, with \"Taxman,\" \"I Want to Tell You\" and \"Love You To,\" challenged Lennon-McCartney's songwriting dominance. \r\n Part of the album's revolutionary impulse was visual. Klaus Voormann, one of the  Beatles ' artist buddies from their days in Hamburg, Germany, designed a striking photo-collage cover for  Revolver ; it was a crucial step on the road to the even trippier, more colorful imagery of  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band , which would come less than a year later. \r\n  Revolver  signaled that in popular music, anything \u2013 any theme, any musical idea \u2013 could now be realized.

{"index": 2, "description": "\"Who's gonna hear this shit?\"  Beach Boys  singer Mike Love asked the band's resident genius,  Brian Wilson , in 1966, as Wilson played him the new songs he was working on. \"The ears of a dog?\" But Love's contempt proved oddly useful: \"Ironically,\" Wilson observed, \"Mike's barb inspired the album's title.\" Barking dogs \u2013 Wilson's dog Banana among them, in fact \u2013 are prominent among the found sounds on the album. The Beatles made a point of echoing them on  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band  \u2013 an acknowledgment that  Pet Sounds  was the inspiration for the Beatles' masterpiece. That gesture actually completed a circle of influence: Wilson initially  conceived of  Pet Sounds  as an effort to top the Beatles'  Rubber Soul . \r\n With its vivid orchestration, lyrical ambition, elegant pacing and thematic coherence,  Pet Sounds  invented \u2013 and in some sense perfected \u2013 the idea that an album could be more than the sum of its parts. When Wilson sang, \"Wouldn't it be nice if we were older?\" on the magnificent opener, he wasn't just imagining a love that could evolve past high school; he was suggesting a new grown-up identity for rock & roll music itself. \r\n Wilson essentially made  Pet Sounds  without the rest of the band, using them only to flesh out the vocal arrangements. (He even considered putting the album out as a solo project, and the first single, \"Caroline, No,\" was released under his own name.) Its luxurious sound conveys a heartbreaking wistfulness, and the deeply personal songs, which Wilson co-wrote primarily with lyricist Tony Asher, bid farewell to the innocent world of the Beach Boys' fun-in-the-sun hits. Unfortunately, Capitol Records proved no more enamored of  Pet Sounds  than had Love; the label considered not releasing it at all. Not yet vindicated by history, Wilson withdrew further into his inner world. \"At the last meeting I attended concerning  Pet Sounds ,\" Wilson wrote about his dealings with the label, \"I showed up holding a tape player and eight prerecorded, looped responses, including 'No comment,' 'Can you repeat that?' 'No' and 'Yes.' Refusing to utter a word, I played the various tapes when appropriate.", "title": "Pet Sounds", "publisher": "Capitol", "year": 1966, "artist": "The Beach Boys"},
{"index": 1, "description": "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band  is the most important rock & roll album ever made, an unsurpassed adventure in concept, sound, songwriting, cover art and studio technology by the greatest rock & roll group of all time. From the title song's regal blasts of brass and fuzz guitar to the orchestral seizure and long, dying piano chord at the end of \"A Day in the Life,\" the 13 tracks on  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band  are the pinnacle of the Beatles' eight years as recording artists.  John Lennon ,  Paul McCartney ,  George Harrison  and  Ringo Starr  were never more fearless and unified in their pursuit of magic and transcendence.  Issued in Britain on June 1st, 1967, and a day later in America,  Sgt. Pepper  is also rock's ultimate declaration of change. For the  Beatles , it was a decisive goodbye to matching suits, world tours and assembly-line record-making. \"We were fed up with being Beatles,\" McCartney said decades later, in  Many Years From Now , Barry Miles' McCartney biography. \"We were not boys, we were men... artists rather than performers.  At the same time,  Sgt. Pepper  formally ushered in an unforgettable season of hope, upheaval and achievement: the late 1960s and, in particular, 1967's Summer of Love. In its iridescent instrumentation, lyric fantasias and eye-popping packaging,  Sgt. Pepper  defined the opulent revolutionary optimism of psychedelia and instantly spread the gospel of love, acid, Eastern spirituality and electric guitars around the globe. No other pop record of that era, or since, has had such an immediate, titanic impact. This music documents the world's biggest rock band at the very height of its influence and ambition.  \"It was a peak,\" Lennon told  Rolling Stone  in 1970, describing both the album and his collaborative relationship with McCartney. \"Paul and I were definitely working together,\" Lennon said, and Sgt. Pepper is rich with proof: McCartney's burst of hot piano and school-days memoir (\"Woke up, fell out of bed...\") in Lennon's \"A Day in the Life,\" a reverie on mortality and infinity; Lennon's impish rejoinder to McCartney's chorus in \"Getting Better\" (\"It can't get no worse\").  \" Sgt. Pepper  was our grandest endeavor,\" Starr said, looking back, in the band's 2000 autobiography,  The Beatles Anthology.  \"The greatest thing about the band was that whoever had the best idea \u2013 it didn't matter who \u2013 that was the one we'd use.\" It was Neil Aspinall, the Beatles' longtime assistant, who suggested they reprise the title track, just before the finale of \"A Day in the Life,\" to complete  Sgt. Pepper 's theatrical conceit: an imaginary concert by a fictional band, played by the Beatles.  The first notes went to tape on December 6th, 1966: two takes of McCartney's music-hall confection \"When I'm Sixty-Four.\" (Lennon's lysergic reflection on his Liverpool childhood, \"Strawberry Fields Forever,\" was started two weeks earlier but issued in February 1967 as a stand-alone single.) But  Sgt. Pepper 's real birthday is August 29th, 1966, when the Beatles played their last live concert, in San Francisco. Until then, they had made history in the studio between punishing tours. Off the road for good, the Beatles were free to be a band away from the hysteria of Beatlemania.  McCartney went a step further. On a plane to London in November '66, as he returned from a vacation in Kenya, he came up with the idea of an album by the Beatles in disguise, an alter-ego group that he subsequently dubbed Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. \"We'd pretend to be someone else,\" McCartney explained in  Anthology . \"It liberated you \u2013 you could do anything when you got to the mic or on your guitar, because it wasn't you.\"  Only two songs on the final LP, both McCartney's, had anything to do with the Pepper characters: the title track and Starr's jaunty vocal showcase, \"With a Little Help From My Friends,\" introduced as a number by  Sgt. Pepper 's star crooner, Billy Shears. \"Every other song could have been on any other album,\" Lennon insisted later. Yet it is hard to imagine a more perfect setting for the Victorian jollity of Lennon's \"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!\" (inspired by an 1843 circus poster) or the sumptuous melancholy of McCartney's \"Fixing a Hole,\" with its blend of antique shadows (a harpsichord played by the Beatles' producer, George Martin) and modern sunshine (double-tracked lead guitar executed with ringing precision by Harrison). The  Pepper  premise was a license to thrill.  It also underscored the real-life cohesion of the music and the group that made it. Of the 700 hours the Beatles spent making  Sgt. Pepper  from the end of 1966 until April 1967, the group needed only three days' worth to complete Lennon's lavish daydream \"Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds.\" \"A Day in the Life,\" the most complex song on the album, was done in just five days. (The oceanic piano chord was three pianos hit simultaneously by 10 hands belonging to Lennon, McCartney, Starr, Martin and Beatles roadie Mal Evans.) No other Beatles appear with Harrison on his sitar-perfumed sermon on materialism and fidelity, \"Within You Without You,\" but the band wisely placed the track at the halfway point of the original vinyl LP, at the beginning of Side Two: a vital meditation break in the middle of the jubilant indulgence.  The Beatles' exploitation of multitracking transformed the very act of studio recording (the orchestral overdubs on \"A Day in the Life\" marked the debut of eight-track recording in Britain: two four-track machines used in sync). And  Sgt. Pepper 's visual extravagance officially elevated the album cover to a work of art. Michael Cooper's photo of the Beat\u00adles in satin marching-band outfits, in front of a cardboard-cutout audience of historical figures, created by artist Peter Blake, is the most enduring image of the psychedelic era.  Sgt. Pepper  was also the first rock album to incorporate complete lyrics to the songs in its design.  Yet  Sgt. Pepper  is the Number One album of the RS 500 not just because of its firsts \u2013 it is simply the best of everything the Beatles ever did as musicians, pioneers and pop stars, all in one place. A 1967 British print ad for the album declared, \"Remember, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band Is the Beatles.\" As McCartney put it, the album was \"just us doing a good show.\"  The show goes on forever.", "title": "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band", "publisher": "Capitol", "year": 1967, "artist": "The Beatles"}
